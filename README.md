# Partwriter

## Goal

The ultimate goal of this program is to allow for people to upload pictures of partwriting assignments, and generate an annotated MusicXML file with a proper analysis and annotated error detection (e.g., following proper voice leading techniques).

## Progress

See the "Projects" tab for detailed progress.

Development will occur in stages:
- [ ] **1. Error checking from part-split MusicXML file**
- [ ] 2. Error checking from combined MusicXML file
- [ ] 3. Analysis for Music XML file
- [ ] 4. Modulation support
- [ ] 5. Error checking from part-split OMR input
- [ ] 6. Error checking from combined OMR input
- [ ] 7. "Musicality" of inputted work

## Dependencies

Uses the amazing [music21](http://web.mit.edu/music21/) library. Without it, this project would never have been possible!
